\usage{
demographic_parity(by)
}
\arguments{
\item{by}{The column identifier for the sensitive feature. This should be an
unquoted column name referring to a column in the un-preprocessed data.}
}
\value{
This function outputs a yardstick \emph{fairness metric} function. Given a
grouping variable \code{by}, \code{demographic_parity()} will return a yardstick metric
function that is associated with the data-variable grouping \code{by} and a
post-processor. The outputted function will first generate a set
of detection_prevalence metric values by group before summarizing across
groups using the post-processing function.

The outputted function only has a data frame method and is intended to
be used as part of a metric set.

\description{
Demographic parity is satisfied when a model's predictions have the
same predicted positive rate across groups. A value of 0 indicates parity
across groups. Note that this definition does not depend on the true
outcome; the \code{truth} argument is included in outputted metrics
for consistency.

\code{demographic_parity()} is calculated as the difference between the largest
and smallest value of \code{\link[=detection_prevalence]{detection_prevalence()}} across groups.

Demographic parity is sometimes referred to as group fairness,
disparate impact, or statistical parity.

See the "Measuring Disparity" section for details on implementation.
}
\section{Measuring Disparity}{

By default, this function takes the difference in range of detection_prevalence
\code{.estimate}s across groups. That is, the maximum pair-wise disparity between
groups is the return value of \code{demographic_parity()}'s \code{.estimate}.

For finer control of group treatment, construct a context-aware fairness
metric with the \code{\link[=new_groupwise_metric]{new_groupwise_metric()}} function by passing a custom \code{aggregate}
function:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{# the actual default `aggregate` is:
diff_range <- function(x, ...) \{diff(range(x$.estimate))\}

demographic_parity_2 <-
  new_groupwise_metric(
    fn = detection_prevalence,
    name = "demographic_parity_2",
    aggregate = diff_range
  )
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

In \code{aggregate()}, \code{x} is the \code{metric_set()} output with detection_prevalence values
for each group, and \code{...} gives additional arguments (such as a grouping
level to refer to as the "baseline") to pass to the function outputted
by \code{demographic_parity_2()} for context.
