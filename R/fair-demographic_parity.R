#' Demographic parity
#'
#' @description
#' Demographic parity is satisfied when a model's predictions have the
#' same predicted positive rate across groups. A value of 0 indicates parity
#' across groups. Note that this definition does not depend on the true
#' outcome; the `truth` argument is included in outputted metrics
#' for consistency.
#'
#' `demographic_parity()` is calculated as the difference between the largest
#' and smallest value of [detection_prevalence()] across groups.
#'
#' Demographic parity is sometimes referred to as group fairness,
#' disparate impact, or statistical parity.
#'
#' See the "Measuring Disparity" section for details on implementation.
#'
#' @param by The column identifier for the sensitive feature. This should be an
#' unquoted column name referring to a column in the un-preprocessed data.
